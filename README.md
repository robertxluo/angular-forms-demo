# Angular Forms 

Angular has two ways to implement forms, template-driven forms and reactive forms. This application showcases both of these forms for learning purposes.

## Template-driven Forms

- Easy to use
- Two-way data binding 
  - Minimal component code
- Automatically tracks form and input element state

## Reactive Forms

- More flexible
  - More complex scenarios
- Immutable data model
- Easier to perform an action on a value change
- Reactive transformations
  - DebounceTime
  - DistinctUntilChanged
- Easily add input elements dynamically
- Easier unit testing
